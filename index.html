        <h3>Quarreling Stopper and Alerting the People</h3>
         <p> Street quarrels are very common scene in India. Their causes are simple but the results are serious. Sometimes peoples quarrel over trifles. These quarrels take a turn for worse and men are involved in it.<br>
             A few days back a quarrel arose between two children. Nitin and Depam were flying kites on the roof of their houses. Their kites got in tangled and Nitin’s kite was cut off from the string. Depam started quarreling and says bad names to him. From hot words, they came to blows. Depam beat Nitin and his head began to bleed. Someone informed Nitin’s father. He lost his temper. He came running. He at once slapped Depam. Soon Depam’s father came to know and he came red with anger. He abused Nitin’s father and hit him. Now the quarrel looks like serious injuries.<br>
    A large number of people gathered on the spot. But no one tried to separate them. At last, someone informed the police. Two constables came. They separated them and asked them to proceed to the police station. Soon, an older man of the street assembled there. They also went to the police station and the quarrel was amicably settled.
